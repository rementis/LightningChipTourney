Using this software you can run a billiards tournament
in "chip" format.

Each player gets a certain amount of chips, typically
based on skill level.

The list of players is randomized and then the matchups begin.

Each race is only one game, loser loses a chip.  When you
are out of chips you are out of the tournament.

When there are just a few players left the tournament will enter Shuffle Mode.  In this mode you will need to manually re-suffle periodically after the matches.  

If you have Fargo scores the software can also keep track so the
scores can be entered.  If you are not using Fargo just enter
anything you like for the Fargo number.

Lightning Chip Tourney has a built in database which keeps track of players previously entered, as well as their Fargo ID.  It also has the ability to automatically assign a chip count based on Fargo score.

Latest update January 2023, now when a table is removed from the tourney the winner gets to flip for break on next match.  Foreit key now available!
